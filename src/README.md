  - [[CI] init group](https://github.com/Cloudforet-dev/actions/actions/workflows/init_group.yaml)
    - need group name input and deploy `push_sync_ci.yaml` to all repositories that have topic matching the group.
  - [[CI] init repository](https://github.com/Cloudforet-dev/actions/actions/workflows/init_repository.yaml)
